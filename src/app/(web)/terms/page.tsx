As part of our Services, we may send you notifications about special offers, products, or additional services available from us, our affiliates, or our partners, that may be of interest to you. Such notifications will typically be sent through newsletters and marketing communications and represent efforts to get to know you and your preferences better across our Services and those of our affiliates. In turn, this enables customisation of the services in line with those preferences.
